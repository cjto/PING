Sexual assault affects up to one out of six women in their lifetime. According to RAINN, the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, there are about just under half of a million victims of rape or sexual assault in the United States each year. Cases of sexual assault are underreported as 63% of sexual assault cases do not get reported to police or the authorities. Consequently, women feel unsafe when attending public events or large social gatherings.

So what is our mission? To find an effective, simple way for individuals to continue throughout their daily lives knowing that they feel protected wherever they may be.

Our team has created a device that utilizes GPS technology and an alert system confined into a small, wearable piece for the user. It aims to add an extra layer of safety for the user by providing the user easy communication with authorities or loved ones in the event of safety issues or loss of cognitive control. This essentially lowers the risk of harm to the user in social interaction settings including, but not limited to, parties and concerts. By lowering this risk, this device combats the high possibility of sexual assault and violence and gives users the incentive to continue attending activities while feeling safe.

We are a group of 15 students currently attending the University of California, Irvine, ranging from engineering to computer science majors. With our previous experiences in academics, internships, and outside projects, we have merged our skills into creating a product that can contribute to improving the safety of the general public. Many of us come from different backgrounds in hardware and software, and through each of our unique contributions, we hope to better the safety of society overall.

As college students, we have all encountered or heard of public safety incidents that affect our ability to feel comfortable in the environment we reside in today. With this problem to tackle, we have brainstormed a way to prevent or minimize these occurrences as much as possible. This way, we can not only continue to enjoy our lives as college students, but to also aid other individuals in our communities.

As part of the software team at PING, we are in the middle of developing the website and mobile application which can be seen below:
